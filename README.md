# FindMore

FindMore allows the user to find movies they are likely to enjoy based on a searched title. The user inputs the name of a movie they already love and FindMore returns collections of movies that contain the searched title. The collections are created by users. The titles in the collections have a theme/commonality, as determined by the user who created the collection. Collections are also rated by users, to help guide collection choosing.

## Instructions
